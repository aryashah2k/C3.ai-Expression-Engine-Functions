2. Use filter, order and having fields in evaluate to further refine your results. 

3. latestValue() and latest() can be used efficiently on normalized data in both metrics and evaluate to find the most recent value of a measurement and its timestamp.

4. Use c3ShowType(EvaluateSpec) to see options for evaluate, including timeRangeStart and timeRangeEnd.
