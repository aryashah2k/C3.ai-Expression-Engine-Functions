## TimeseriesDataPoint: avg and sum Expression Engine Functions and Treatment

### Key Takeaways:

1. The treatment (e.g. avg or previous) applied to the SmartBulbMeasurement temperature field affects how data points are handled during normalization. 

2. The avg(avg()) or avg(sum()) Expression Engine Functions in the metric expression affect how data is averaged or summed across multiple normalized intervals depending on the metric interval and normalization interval.
