# Module 1

## Get the Package, Do the Challenge

The goal of this exercise is to populate the SmartBulb Type using the imperfect csv source file.  If you have existing data on your tag, you will want to execute SmartBulb.removeAll() prior to starting this exercise. 

The sample file for SourceSmartBulb is called SmartBulb_Transform.csv.  It is available in the SampleSeedData folder.  Move this file to lightbulbExercise/seed/SourceSmartBulb prior to beginning the exercise. 

After completing the exercise and successfully provisioning, execute c3Grid(SmartBulb.fetch()) to make sure the data looks correct for the id, manufacturer, and isLED fields.
